This AI-powered system provides a comprehensive and highly granular analysis of a user's resume, going beyond superficial checks to offer deep, context-aware insights. Its core functionalities include:

● Targeted Resume Rating:

○ Job Role Specificity: Users input their desired job role. The AI then evaluates the resume against the typical requirements, keywords, and industry standards for that specific role.

○ Company-Centric Analysis: Users can specify a target company . The AI analyzes the company's publicly available information (e.g., career pages, mission statements, recent news, employee profiles on LinkedIn) to identify key values, preferred terminology, and cultural nuances. The resume is then rated on its alignment with these company-specific attributes, in addition to the job role.

○ ATS Optimization Score: A detailed score indicating how well the resume is optimized to pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) for the specified role and company, highlighting missing keywords, formatting issues, and structural elements that might hinder parsing.

● Detailed Recommendation Generation:

○ Content Enhancement: Suggestions for improving bullet points to be more achievement-oriented, quantifiable, and relevant to the target role/company. This includes identifying and recommending the inclusion of industry-specific keywords and phrases.

○ Format and Aesthetics: Recommendations on resume layout, font choices, section ordering, and overall visual clarity to ensure professional presentation and ATS compatibility. This also includes identifying and advising on the removal of "noise" that can confuse ATS or recruiters.

○ Skill Gap Identification: Based on the target role and company, the AI identifies specific skills that are either missing from the resume or insufficiently highlighted, but are crucial for the desired position.

○ Personalized Learning Paths: For identified skill gaps, the system recommends specific courses, certifications, workshops, or online resources.
